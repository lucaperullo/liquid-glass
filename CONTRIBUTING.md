   npm install
   ```

4. Create a branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:watch
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Run Storybook for component development:**
   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

4. **Lint your code:**

   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Type check:**
   ```bash

### Project Structure

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LiquidGlass/    # Base component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GlassButton/    # Button component

```

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
* Use arrow functions for inline functions
* Prefer `const` over `let` when possible

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a glass morphism effect configuration
 * @param variant - The visual variant to use
 * @param overrides - Custom property overrides
 * @returns Computed glass configuration
 */
export const getGlassConfig = (
  variant: GlassVariant,
  overrides: Partial<BaseGlassProps> = {}
): GlassConfig => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Component Guidelines

1. **File Structure:**
   ```
   ComponentName/
   â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.tsx
   â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.types.ts
   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
   ```

2. **TypeScript Props:**
   ```typescript
   export interface ComponentProps extends BaseGlassProps {
     specificProp?: string;
     onAction?: () => void;
   }
   ```

3. **Component Template:**
   ```typescript
   import React from 'react';
   import { ComponentProps } from './Component.types';
   
   const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
     children, 
     variant = "default",
     ...props 
   }) => {
     return (
       <LiquidGlass variant={variant} {...props}>
         {children}
       </LiquidGlass>
     );
   };
   
   export default Component;
   ```

### Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for all new components
* Use React Testing Library
* Test user interactions, not implementation details
* Aim for high code coverage

Example:
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import Component from '../Component';

describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders children correctly', () => {
    render(<Component>Test content</Component>);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test content')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('handles click events', () => {
    const handleClick = jest.fn();
    render(<Component onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Component>);
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Click me'));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```
